package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

	for {
		fmt.Print("GoShell $ ")
		scanner.Scan()
		command := scanner.Text()
		if strings.TrimSpace(command) == "break" {
			break
		} else {
			// Execute other commands
			// ...
		}
	}
}
In this example, we create a simple Go shell that reads input from the user using bufio.Scanner. Inside the loop, we prompt the user for input with "GoShell $ ". If the user enters "break", the loop is exited using the break statement.

You can integrate this code into your existing Go shell implementation and customize it further as per your requirements. This is just a basic example to demonstrate how the "break" builtin command can be implemented in Go.
